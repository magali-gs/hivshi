## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive physics simulation** - Real-time physics engine powered by Matter.js
- **Mouse control** - Click and drag shapes to interact with the environment
- **Responsive canvas** - Adaptive rendering based on device pixel ratio and window dimensions
- **Textured shapes** - Custom sprite-based objects with physics properties like friction and bounce
- **Dynamic environment** - Static walls and boundaries combined with movable objects
