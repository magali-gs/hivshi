# HivsHi: Experimental JavaScript Project

HivsHi is a creative and experimental JavaScript project developed as part of the SuperHi Experimental JavaScript course. It's an interactive web experience featuring physics-driven shapes and real-time interactions using the Matter.js physics engine.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Physics Simulation** - Real-time physics engine powered by Matter.js
- **Mouse Control** - Click and drag shapes to interact with the environment
- **Responsive Canvas** - Adaptive rendering based on device pixel ratio and window dimensions
- **Textured Shapes** - Custom sprite-based objects with physics properties like friction and bounce
- **Dynamic Environment** - Static walls and boundaries combined with movable objects

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Matter.js

## 📚 Acknowledgments
